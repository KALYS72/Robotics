# RFID and Keypad Based Door Lock System

This project demonstrates how to build an RFID-based door lock system with an additional keypad for enhanced security. It allows users to unlock a door using an RFID tag or by entering a PIN on a keypad. The system uses an Arduino UNO as the central microcontroller and incorporates a display for visual feedback.

## Features
- Dual authentication: RFID tag and/or keypad PIN.
- Visual feedback through LEDs and an LCD.
- Audio feedback with a buzzer.
- Simple and customizable design.

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the components as follows:
- RFID Reader: SDA -> A4, SCL -> A5, VCC -> 3.3V, GND -> GND
- Keypad: Connect rows and columns to digital pins (adjust in code).
- LEDs:
  - Green LED -> Pin 8 (indicates access granted)
  - Red LED -> Pin 9 (indicates access denied)
  - Yellow LED -> Pin 10 (indicates system ready)
- Buzzer: Connect to Pin 11.
- LCD: SDA -> A4, SCL -> A5, VCC -> 5V, GND -> GND
- Power: Arduino powered via USB or external 9V battery.

## How It Works
1. **RFID Authentication**: The RFID reader scans the tag. If it matches a pre-stored tag ID, access is granted.
2. **Keypad PIN Entry**: If a valid PIN is entered via the keypad, access is granted.
3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Green LED lights up for success.
   - Red LED lights up for failure.
   - Yellow LED remains on when the system is ready.
4. **Audio Feedback**: Buzzer beeps during operations for additional feedback.
5. **LCD Display**: Shows system status and prompts.
